Research Question
Is there any correlation between suicide rates and factors such as gender, age, and gdp?S



Abstract
Suicide has become one of the most important issues that psychiatrists and psychologists deal with, especially in our century.
  In the last 45 years, the world suicide rate has increased by 60% and suicide deaths are expected to reach 1.6 million by 2022.
In my project, I used various factors such as age, gender, and geographic region to find out what had a major impact on the suicide rate.
To compare different factors, I aimed to draw meaningful conclusions by visualizing whether the correlation was weak or strong, with graphs and various Python codes.
My focus was on whether suicide was affected by age, gender, place of residence, or the country's monetary status (GDP). I hope this study will help suicide prevention strategies for countries.


The dataset provides information on suicide rates worldwide. This data set includes suicide information for the years 1985 and 2016. There are about 27,000 data from 100 countries. Suicide rates dataset includes country, year, gender, age , suicide_no, population, ,country-year, HDI for year, gdp_for_year, gdp_per_capita and generation.
 Data Analysis is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, report results, and support decision making.
While data analysis is used in different fields of business, science and social science, it has multiple aspects and approaches that cover different techniques under various names.

In my project, I will analyze the factors associated with suicide rates among different relationships in various countries between 1985 and 2016. I will first look at whether there is any association with suicide rates among various factors such as age, gender, continent and generation, GDP. I want to analyze suicide data and find out which factors are most likely to cause suicide.
Death by suicide is an extremely complex issue that afflicts hundreds of thousands of people around the world each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 800,000 people die by suicide each year.
Suicide rate is calculated as one in 100 thousand people all over the world. Looking at the countries with the highest suicide rate in the world, it is difficult to find a clear partnership between them.
After the knowledge that suicide is a global problem and approximately 800,000 people die every year, I decided to raise awareness by working on this issue.
  I want to analyze suicide data and find out which factors are most likely to cause suicide.
In my project, I used various factors such as age, gender and geographic region, generation to find out what had a major impact on the suicide rate. To compare different factors, to find out whether the correlation is strong or weak, I used graphs and made interpretive conclusions.

The results we expect to find;
Are younger individuals more prone to suicide?
Do men commit suicide more than women?
Suicide increases with age
Suicide is less in countries with high GDP?
Does the generation gap affect suicide?

  Results and Discussion 
  
  First, it asks what causes suicides globally, which is our problem, and who affects them.
The scope of my project has covered many countries over the last thirty years. I worked with the Kaggle called 'Suicide Rates Overview 1985 - 2016' dataset, as the results of my project were to gather information about what causes suicides around the world.
Data are organized by country, male or female, and age, generation and continents, and the number of suicides per year.
I analyzed various analytical elements to see correlations between age, gender, year and GDP to get the most unbiased analysis possible.


  The distribution of suicide rates among age ranges shows us that the general prejudice about suicide is most prevalent in the younger group. The distribution says that neither teenagers nor young adults are in the most common age range for suicide rates. Mid-adults showed the highest suicide rate, with children and youth was even more than the sum of their rates.

  Why was the middle adult population at such a high risk of suicide between 1985 and 2016?
Wars, scientific development, technology, industry, social changes, economic crises and/or many possible situations in our environment can affect our actions towards ourselves more.

It shows that the high variability of suicide rates in men over the years has increased, and sometimes even doubled, compared to women. The data show that middle-aged adults aged 35 to 74 have the highest number of suicides. Seniors and adolescents are about half as old as middle-aged adults.
Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adults worldwide.
  The data show worrying differences in suicide for the different sexes. It is clear that men are more suicidal than women.

While rates did not differ much from the mid to late 1980s, after 1990 there is a huge difference in male suicide, but not so much in female suicide.

The data also allow us to see that population size is a great indicator and one of the reasons for suicide rates in general.

 People living in countries with larger populations have a higher rate of attempting and committing suicide than countries with smaller populations.


In the data, annual GDP also appears to be a key point in suicide rates. In addition, a higher GDP seems to be associated with higher suicide rates.


We might think that a person killed himself because of financial problems, puberty problems or gender and many guesses. But the reality doesn't even seem close to these predictions.
People commit suicide and we can't generalize that. We shouldn't try to mold it. . Suicide is not like other harmful or negative actions because ending one's life is more than statistical data.
